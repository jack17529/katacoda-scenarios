In this section, we will train a Perceptron model using stochastic gradient descent on the
Sonar dataset. The example assumes that a CSV copy of the dataset is in the current working
directory with the file name sonar.all-data.csv.<br />

The dataset is first loaded, the string values
converted to numeric and the output column is converted from strings to the integer values
of 0 to 1. This is achieved with helper functions load csv(), str column to float() and
str column to int() to load and prepare the dataset.

			if not row:
				continue
			dataset.append(row)
	return dataset

# Convert string column to float

We will use k-fold cross-validation to estimate the performance of the learned model on
unseen data. This means that we will construct and evaluate k models and estimate the
performance as the mean model error. Classification accuracy will be used to evaluate each
model. These behaviors are provided in the cross validation split(), accuracy metric()
and evaluate algorithm() helper functions.

'''
A k value of 3 was used for cross-validation, giving each fold 208 3 = 69:3 or just under 70
records to be evaluated upon each iteration. A learning rate of 0.1 and 500 training epochs were
chosen with a little experimentation. You can try your own configurations and see if you can
beat my score.
Running this example prints the scores for each of the 3 cross-validation folds then prints
the mean classification accuracy. We can see that the accuracy is about 72%, higher than the
baseline value of just over 50%.
